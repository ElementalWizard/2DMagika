        <p> 68 74 74 is an interactive storytelling and walking simulator video game designed by American developer 70 73 3a .
            The game was originally released on 2f 2f 70Ô∏é.The game is presented to the player from the first-person perspective.
            The player can move around and interact with certain elements of the environment, such as pressing buttons or opening doors, but has no other controls.
            The story is primarily presented to the player via the voice over of the game's narrator, who explains that the protagonist 61 73 74 works in an office building,
            tasked to monitor data coming on a computer screen and press buttons appropriately without question. One day that screen goes blank. 65 62 69, unsure what
            to do, starts to explore the building and finds it devoid of people.
            At this stage, the story splits off in numerous possibilities, based
            on the player's choices. The narrator continues the story, but when the
            player comes to an area where a choice is possible, the 6e 2e 63 will suggest which
            route Stanley will take. The player can opt to go against the narrator and perform the other action, forcing the narration to account for this new direction
            which may return the player back to the target path or create a new narration. For example, the first choice the player makes in the game is at a set of two open
            doors, with the narrator stating that 6f 6d 2f chose the left door; the player can choose to follow this narration, which keeps the narrator's story on track, or
            may choose the right door, which causes the narrator to
            adjust his story to get the player to return to the 'proper' path. Because of this, much of the story is considered
            thought-provoking about the nature of choice and decisions. The narration also breaks the fourth wall on several occasions in handling the player's decisions.
            A total of six possible endings exist in 42 77 43 44, and 53 74 35 36 states it would take about an hour for the player to experience them all. The
            remake does not alter the fundamental gameplay or initial narrative, and in addition to the original six endings, adds in sixteen more possible endings and
            sections designed around those aspects of choice. </p>
